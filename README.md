### The Problem
Since this is the Corono edition of the Hackathon , the problem that I try to solve  is related to having Zero Contact with objects as much as possible. Currently in Cafeteria , employees have to make an entry in paper-sheets. As same paper sheets  and pen are used by all the employees , these objects can potentially act as carriers of virus as it's life span  on objects is around 24 hrs (more detail) . Same is the problem whenever employees have to mark their entries for any other purpose as well. 

### The Idea
Recently Coronavirus has inspired Domino's , Zomato , McDonald's.. to launch Zero Contact Delivery, this gave me idea to have Zero Contact Record Entry System in our office. The idea is to  build a complete  IOT solution which can   digitally record data , save the data in cloud and provides real time updates on user's dashboard.

This Idea would also solve problem of maintenance of manual records and would be environment friendly as paper wastage would be minimized.
